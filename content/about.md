title = "About"

I'm a runner, climber, and software engineer based in Sheffield, England.

For the last 3 or so years I've worked for Grafana Labs on their AI/ML team,
working with Go, Python, Typescript and React.

In my spare time I've also been developing the [augurs] time series library
for Rust (and Javascript/Python), along with a few other Rust tools or
libraries.
