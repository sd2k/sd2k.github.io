Wow, starting blogging is harder than I thought it would be. How on earth does anyone know what to write about?

I think I'm going to start with this boring, useless post that says literally nothing. At least that breaks the spell of not writing anything. I reckon it's very easy to agonise over this stuff until it's perfect and never publish _anything_, so this is me avoiding it.

Maybe the next post will contain something interesting!
